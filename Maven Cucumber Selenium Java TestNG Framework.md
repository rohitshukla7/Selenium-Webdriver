Here are the steps to create a Maven Cucumber Selenium Java TestNG Framework:

Install Java on your machine, if not already installed. You can download it from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Install Maven on your machine, if not already installed. You can download it from the official website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Create a new Maven project using the command-line or your preferred IDE.

Add the following dependencies to the pom.xml file:

php
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
    <version>6.10.2</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
    <version>6.10.2</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
    <version>6.10.2</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>3.141.59</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.0.0</version>
</dependency>
Create a "features" folder in the src/test/resources directory, and create your Cucumber feature files in this folder. These feature files will contain the test scenarios.

Create a "stepdefinitions" package in the src/test/java directory, and create your step definition classes in this package. These classes will contain the code that maps to the steps in your Cucumber feature files.

Create a "pages" package in the src/test/java directory, and create your Page Object classes in this package. These classes will contain the code that interacts with the web pages in your application.

Create a "tests" package in the src/test/java directory, and create your TestNG test classes in this package. These classes will contain the code that runs your Cucumber tests.

Create a "utils" package in the src/test/java directory, and create your utility classes in this package. These classes will contain the code that you can reuse across your tests.

Write your Cucumber feature files, step definition classes, Page Object classes, and TestNG test classes to implement your tests.

Run your tests using the command-line or your preferred IDE.

That's it! You now have a Maven Cucumber Selenium Java TestNG Framework that you can use to run your automated tests.
